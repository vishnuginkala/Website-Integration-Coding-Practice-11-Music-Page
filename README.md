Music Page

In this assignment, let's build a Music Page by applying the concepts we learned till now. You can use the Bootstrap concepts and CCBP UI Kit as well.

Refer to the below images.
Music Home Page:

<img width="387" height="770" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25ab03a8-6e28-4298-9661-e9bfad01bb35" />

Music Details Page:

<img width="357" height="662" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2a5c6cc-3143-497f-91c1-ad8e02b24352" />

Note
When clicked on the Get Started button on the Music Home Page, it must display the Music Details Page.
Try to achieve the design as close as possible.

Important Note
Warning
The CCBP UI kit works only if the value of the HTML id attribute of the container section has the prefix as section. So, the id which we specify for any section should always contain its prefix as section if you are using CCBP UI Kit.

Sections must be parallel and not nested within each other.

HTML
<div id="sectionHomePage">...</div>
<div id="sectionConferencePage">...</div>

Avoid assigning Bootstrap flex properties directly to a section container.

Example
Wrong usage:
 
HTML
<div id="sectionHomepage" class="d-flex">
  ...
</div>
